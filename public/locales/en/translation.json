      "1title": "Maximizing Efficiency and Sustainability: Product Characterization at Scrap Yards",
      "1description1": "As the world continues to emphasize sustainability and environmental responsibility, industries are seeking ways to optimize their operations. One area that holds immense potential for improving efficiency is the recycling of scrap. By implementing regular product characterization by particle size and material composition, current operations can unlock significant benefits by minimizing waste, generating valuable coproducts and maximizing profitability.",
      "1description2": "Product characterization refers to the systematic evaluation of products and materials generated by the process. Instead of treating all items as generic ferrous scrap, nonferrous metals or waste, this approach involves identifying, sorting, and assessing the value and potential applications of each material type for each particle size class. This analysis is conducted manually and serves as a first step to evaluate machine efficiencies, identify bottle necks and justify modifications of the existing equipment adjustments and size or even of the complete recycling process adopted in the plant.",
      "1description3": "Besides the pure evaluation of the actual products generated by the processing plant, special attention has to be paid to obtaining representative samples of each of the product streams. A5 has a long-time experience for effective homogenization and representative sampling for a large variety of materials, product analysis, interpretation of the results, identification of process routes for recovering valuable material. This also includes simulations of various modifications within the plant to evaluate highest impact with lowest effort.",
