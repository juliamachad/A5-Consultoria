    "1title": "Increasing Efficiency and Sustainability: Characterization of products in scrap recycling operations",
    "1description1": "As the world continues to emphasize sustainability and environmental responsibility, industries seek ways to optimize their operations. One area with immense potential for efficiency improvement is scrap recycling. By implementing regular characterization of products by particle size and material composition, current operations can reap significant benefits by minimizing waste, generating valuable byproducts, and maximizing profitability.",
    "1description2": "Product characterization involves the systematic evaluation of products and materials generated by the process. Instead of treating all items as generic ferrous scrap, non-ferrous metals, or waste, this approach involves identifying, classifying, and evaluating the value and potential applications of each material type for each particle size class. This analysis is performed manually and serves as a first step in assessing machine efficiency, identifying bottlenecks, and justifying modifications to existing equipment settings and sizing or even the entire recycling process adopted in the plant. In addition to the pure evaluation of the actual products generated by the processing plant, special attention must be paid to obtaining representative samples of each of the product streams.",
    "1description3": "A5 has extensive experience in effective homogenization and representative sampling for a wide variety of materials, product analysis, interpretation of results, identification of process routes for valuable material recovery. This also includes simulations of various modifications within the plant to assess the greatest impact with the least effort.",
